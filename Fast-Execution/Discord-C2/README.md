# PoshCord-C2

MAIN SCRIPT HERE - https://github.com/beigeworm/PoshCord-C2

**SYNOPSIS**

Using a Discord webhook and a hosted text file to Act as a Command and Control Platform.

**INFORMATION**

This script will wait until it notices a change in the contents of a text file hosted online (eg. github/pastebin).
Every 10 seconds it will check a file for a change in the file contents and interpret it as a custom command / module.

**SETUP**
1. Goto https://pastebin.com and make an account..
2. Create an empty paste/file and copy the RAW url.
3. Change YOUR_FILE_URL to the RAW url  eg. https://pastebin.com/QeCLTdea -OR- http://your.server.ip.here/files/file.txt
